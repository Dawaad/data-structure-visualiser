# data-structure-visualiser

This is a project that helps visualise data structures such as graphs (and more data structures in the future), and to then run and visualise popular common algorithms for these data structures (ie. BFS, Dijkstras, ...)


**This project does not use any external libraries to create and visualise these data structures, and was done with pure ts**
